dpt-js
======

JavaScript interpreter specially made for the DPT-Board and OpenWRT. It provides
much functionality out of the box. The basis of this engine is the dukluv project
found on <http://dukluv.io/>. 

The dukluv project provided us with the duktape ECMA script interpreter with libuv
bindings for efficiÃ«nt eventloop processing.
